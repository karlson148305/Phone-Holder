# Phone-Holder
Collaboration between three peers on an innovative phone holder project, where we designed and developed a prototype that significantly enhances usability and functionality. Our design allows users to effortlessly adjust the viewing angle to any comfortable position, providing an optimized hands-free experience.

                             A.   INTRODUCTION
The Phone Holder was imagined and designed to permit free and easier movement (rotation) of a phone.

Our objective was to achieve that goal, make it possible in the simplest way it can be.

The issues was to attempt the project and acquired knowledge from it.

                            B.  CONCEPTION

So far as we went, we did the following;

Drawn the mock-up(phone holder) and realize it using the 3D printer in the FABLAB.  « MEC »

Done the electrical connection of the phone holder. « EEE »

Wrote a code (or program) to control the stepper motor using a joystick in the IDE Arduino.  « MIA ».

                            C.  DOMAINS

MEO: Our project plan was design to start by the Structure in order to place the circuit and then implement the code.

MEC: Our phone holder is acts on the user for him/her to Aurelian hold his phone and adjust his angle of view without any strain using the joystick.

EEM: The base of our phone holder if made out of wood and its upper part is made of ABS.

EEE: The joystick and motor are implemented using a circuit connected via Arduino and power by a 9V battery.

MIA: The joystick was programmed to make the motor rotate clockwise when it is shifted to the right and vice versa.

                            D.  FUNCTION:

The phone holder  permits the user to execute free rotatory movement in the x- direction using the joystick.

The z-movement is done manually by the user at the trunk level.
